  # <p align="center">E-Commerce-Back-End

  ## Description  
The purpose of this challenge was to fill the backend for an e-commerce site. This included creating get, post, put, and delete routes, creating models for categories, products, tags and product tags, then connecting the two so that data could be created, read, updated and deleted in the database. This project utilizes postgres and node to accomplish this.
